I have an existing React + Next.js dashboard that could use a focused round of improvements. The core of the work is straightforward: jump into the current codebase, clean up a few rough edges, and polish the overall experience so it feels faster and more refined.

You’ll receive a private GitHub repo as soon as we start. From there I’d like you to:

• Review the current components and streamline any obviously heavy renders or prop drilling issues.
• Apply lightweight UI tweaks so the layout feels snappier and more consistent across breakpoints.
• Hook your changes into the existing build pipeline (Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS) and confirm everything passes CI before submitting a merge request.

I’m looking for someone who can move quickly, communicate clearly in Git commits, and leave the code a bit cleaner than you found it. If you’ve shipped production work with Next.js’s latest features (App Router, server components, etc.) you’ll feel right at home.

Deliverable: a single pull request ready to merge, fully lint-clean, and accompanied by a brief change log summarizing what you touched and why.
